💻 Laptop Price Predictor Web Application

A Machine Learning based web application that predicts the price of a laptop based on its specifications such as RAM, weight, company, CPU, GPU, operating system, and more.


This project is built using:

🐍 Python

🌐 Flask

📊 NumPy

🤖 Machine Learning (Pickle Model)

🎨 HTML & CSS


🚀 Features -----

- User-friendly web interface

- Predicts laptop price instantly

- Uses trained ML model (predictor.pickle)

- Supports multiple laptop brands and configurations

- Converts predicted value into LKR currency


🖥️ Input Parameters ----

The model takes the following inputs:
- RAM (GB)

- Weight (Kg)

- Company (Acer, Apple, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Toshiba, Other)

- Type (Gaming, Ultrabook, Notebook, etc.)

- Operating System (Windows, Mac, Linux, Other)

- CPU (Intel i3, i5, i7, AMD, Other)

- GPU (Intel, AMD, Nvidia)

- Touchscreen (Yes/No)

- IPS Display (Yes/No)

⚙️ How It Works-----

- User enters laptop specifications

- Flask collects form data.

- Categorical values are converted into one-hot encoded format.

- The trained machine learning model predicts the price.


🧠 Machine Learning Model ----

- The model is saved using pickle.

- It loads inside the prediction() function.

- Feature engineering includes:
Numeric features,
Boolean features,
One-hot encoding for categorical features,
The result is displayed in LKR.
